Mini NFT Minting App - Bug Report
‚ö†Ô∏è Bug Summary

This is a mini app built to mint NFTs on Solana and EVM chains within the Farcaster ecosystem (Immunify platform).

‚úÖ Expected Behavior:

On both Solana and EVM chains, the app should display the mint price before confirming the mint action.

The user should see a preview of the NFT before confirming the mint.

The minted NFT should be transferable to other wallets.

‚ùå Actual Bug Behavior:

When minting on Solana:

The mint price is not displayed.

The user can proceed to confirm the mint without seeing the NFT preview.

After minting, the NFT is successfully created but is locked in the Farcaster wallet and cannot be transferred to any other wallet.

When minting on EVM chains:

Mint price is displayed as expected.

NFT preview is shown before confirmation.

NFT is transferable after minting.

REACT_APP_CHAIN = "solana" or "evm"  # Test both chains
REACT_APP_RPC_URL = "<RPC_ENDPOINT_FOR_CHAIN>"
REACT_APP_WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY = "<Your Private Key>" # Farcaster wallet private key
REACT_APP_API_URL = "<Farcaster API URL>"

4Ô∏è‚É£ Build and Deploy

Now repeat the same flow with EVM chain:

‚úÖ Mint price is displayed.

‚úÖ NFT preview is shown.

‚úÖ NFT is transferable after minting.

üìã Additional Notes

The issue appears to be isolated to Solana mints on Farcaster.

The locking of NFT to the Farcaster wallet suggests a problem with token standards or Solana-specific configuration.
